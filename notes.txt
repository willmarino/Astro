  - add functionality to let player shoot down homing missiles

  XXXXX-first, change projectile move method, right now it is checking for owner position
    in order to change velocity accordingly, owner is often computer, it needs to only be checking
    for human position, thats all that matters for this purpose 
  
  -Right now when a projectile collides with an enemy, it is no longer drawn, but it is still functional in the game,
  I need to take it out of the game entirely once it hits an enemy

  -00000reorganize collision logic so that collision funtions are in a util file, and they are called in game file, instead of being
    spread out into different class files. This will make my code more readable generally, and in particular make it easier to debug
    issues with collision.
    - I want to pull up human and computer projectiles and then I want to check for any collisions between human, computers,
    homing missles, and projectiles. I will filter out the projectiles which have collided, and the ones which are off screen,
    (if they are not homing missles, as they should be able to come back and hit players from off screen), animate them, and then send
    the newly filter lists of projectiles back down to the human and computer players.
    00000- Offset projectile id counter in each computer so that they dont overlap when pulled all together up into game file
    - Commented out rendering, filtration, and collision detection of projectiles in human class
    - Everything seems to be working!

  00000-For unknown reason, when one homing projectils is shot, the other dissapears - (default values in constructors must be last)

  - Work on moving configureProjectile out into its own file
  - fixed projectiles dissapearing if their owner dies

  -Need to work on projectiles dissapearing at random
  - fixed, changed how I was setting projectile id's, in order to prevent overlap/overwriting of projectiles when they were
    pulled up into game.js together
